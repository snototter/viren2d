viren2d: Computer Vision Results, but Nice-Looking
==================================================

``viren2d`` is a light-weight toolbox to visualize common 2D computer vision results (read: *detections, trajectories, and the like*) in both **Python and C++** environments.
Under the hood, ``viren2d`` uses the `Cairo graphics library <https://www.cairographics.org/>`_, so visually unpleasing results will hopefully only be caused by questionable color/style choices :wink:.
