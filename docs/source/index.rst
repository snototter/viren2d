   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.
   
.. warning::
   ``viren2d`` has not yet reached a stable `v1.0` release. Currently,
   it is highly experimental and quite incomplete!
   
   An initial stable version `v1.0` will hopefully be released around
   September/October 2022 (this is only a hobby/leisure time project).
   I do NOT recommend using this toolbox before v1.0 - don't say I
   didn't warn you! Until then, the API may (and will) change anytime,
   most features are still not properly tested, python bindings are
   incomplete, *etc.*


Visualize Common Computer Vision Results in 2D
==============================================

``viren2d`` (*Visualize results not too disgraceful*) is a toolbox to visualize common 2D computer vision results in both
**C++ and Python** environments.


**What can I use it for?**
  You can use it to easily overlay *detections, trajectories, text,* and more
  on your image data. To get an idea of its capabilities, check the exemplary
  visualizations in the :ref:`quickstart tutorial<quickstart>` .


**What's under the hood?**
   To ensure proper rendering of your visualizations, ``viren2d`` relies on the
   `Cairo graphics library <https://www.cairographics.org/>`_.


**How do I pronounce viren2d?**
   "*vi-ren-2d*", with *vi* as in *vision* and *ren* as in *rendering*. This is
   by the way also how you pronounce the German word *Viren* (viruses). I could
   have been affected by the aftermath of the pandemic when picking a name...


**How do I get started?**
   * Look up the :ref:`installation instructions<installation>`
   * Browse the :ref:`quickstart tutorial<quickstart>`
   * Check the :ref:`API documentation<api-documentation>`
