Visualize Common Computer Vision Results in 2D
==============================================

``viren2d`` (*Visualize results not too disgraceful*) is a toolbox to visualize common 2D computer vision results in both
**C++ and Python** environments.


**What can I use it for?**
  You can use it to easily overlay *detections, trajectories, text,* and more
  on your image data.


**What's under the hood?**
   To ensure proper rendering of your visualizations, ``viren2d`` relies on the
   `Cairo graphics library <https://www.cairographics.org/>`_.


**How do I pronounce viren2d?**
   "*vi-ren-2d*", with *vi* as in *vision* and *ren* as in *rendering*. This is
   by the way also how you pronounce the German word *Viren* (viruses). I could
   have been affected by the aftermath of the pandemic when picking a name...
